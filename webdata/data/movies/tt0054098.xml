One of Hindi cinema's best known films ever, It took nine years and
enormous expense to complete this historical based in the closing years
of Akbar's reign (1556-1605). So lavish were the sets of the film that
people used to come from distant places to just see them.The film narrates the story of Prince Salim's (later Jahangir
1605-1628) love for Anarkali, a singer. A love his father strongly
disapproves of. But so strong is Salim's love for Anarkali that he goes
to battle against his father. Akbar defeats Salim in battle and orders
him to be executed.However, according to the royal decree, the Salim can be saved from
dying if Anarkali dies in his place. Anarkali, spunky woman that she
is, however does her own thing by defying Akbar in his palace. The song
'Pyaar Kiya to Darna Kya' went on to become one of the most popular
songs ever recorded and the Sheesh Mahal created for the song was a
major attraction for the crowds.According to legend, Akbar ordered Anarkali to be walled alive, but the
film shows that unknown to Salim, Akbar spares her. A melodrama, rather
loudly done, the film had a large star cast including Prithviraj Kapoor
as Akbar, Dilip Kumar as Salim, Madhubala (Anarkali) and Durga Khote as
Jodha Bai.Its watch worth.

Haha -- when I see comments that put Kuch Kuch Hota Hain or any other
formulaic hindi flick as "the best film ever" they obviously didn't see K.
Asif's vision of Mughal-e-Azam.
From Prithviraj Kapoor's magnificent rendering of the imposing Emperor
Akbar
to Dalip Kumar's obvious love for the spectacular Madhubhala.
The exquisite Urdu dialogues is of course not for the neophyte.  But for
those that can appreciate the finer things in life -- not some cloying Hum
Apke Hain Kaun or Shah Rukh Khan's obsession with bleeding and overacting
in
every single film -- Mughal-e-Azam fits the bill perfectly.

The ostentatious look, the unforgettable music, the awesome war scenes,
superb performances, the well-known romance between Salim and Anarkalis
MUGHAL-E-AZAM will always remain as a point of reference.After 44 years, this masterpiece has been released after reviving it in
color (the original version was 85 percent black and white and 15
percent colour), with an upgraded, contemporary sound system (Dolby
Digital).The Story is about the Ruler Akbar (Prithviraj Kapoor) and Queen Jodha
(Durga Khote) give birth to a son, Salim, after years of prayer.Prince Salim (Dilip Kumar) grows into a commendable combatant. Salim
falls in love with court dancer Anarkali (Madhubala). Initially wary of
his affections because of the difference in their positions, she soon
reciprocates his love.Akbar finds out about the affair and that creates a rift between the
father and son. It is a must see movie for every moviegoer for its pure canvass, for
its majestic framing and not just for being a colorful costume drama,
for its romance, for the glorious Sheesh Mahal and also for our fake
filmmakers (like karan johar, aditya chopra, nikhil advani, kunal kohli
and many others like them) who cannot think beyond Manhattan and
singing heroes and have light years to reach this level of film-making. MUGHAL-E-AZAM is a must for those who have seen it in B &amp; W. Now watch
it in color and experience the grandeur. MUGHAL-E-AZAM is a must for
todays generation, who, perhaps, may not have watched this classic.
Watch this epic and you will realize the difference between the cinema
of yore and the cinema of today. MUGHAL-E-AZAM is a must for every
moviegoer. Here is a prime example of pure, unadulterated cinema. 4 Â½
Out of 5

I haven't seen the black and white original of Mughal E Azam since the
'80's, but I recently saw the restored revived colourised 2004
re-release for the first time and was astounded by the results. I'm not
a believer in messing around with the originals, but bearing in mind
director Asif always wanted to make the whole film in colour but didn't
have enough money the "final" product is amazing to see - such is
technology! It was incredibly expensive to make as it was, the
restoration process must have cost a fabulous amount too.Seminal Indian epic purporting to deal with events from about 400 years
ago around Prince Saleem (Dilip Kumar) falling in love with a court
dancer Anarkali (Madhubala) to his father Akbar's utter opposition and
eventually causing a rift leading to all out war. The drama and war
spectacle scenes are memorable enough, with thousands of humans and
animals as extras, and the music is uniformly superb too. But it's Pyar
Kiya To Darna Kya (If I have loved someone&gt;why should I be afraid?)
sung by Anarkali (Lata) to the 2 of them in the Hall Of Mirrors that is
absolutely stunning - I will have to get the original and compare,
because the remaster seems to have turned this song into something even
more magical and mesmerising than I remembered. It took Naushad and
Shakeel Badayuni one night to compose music and lyrics so timeless - a
colourful piece of poetry in motion, with the insistent kaleidoscopic
climax added by Asif. Awesome! According to the legend it was supposed
to have an unhappy ending - needless to say I'm glad it was altered
here to a happy one after such a roller-coaster ride!A tremendous work of Art, showing the very best of Indian cinema.

When one thinks of great movies they remember the classics such as gone
with the wind, Ben hur etc... but let us not forget one of the greatest
cinematic triumphs of Hindi Cinema Mughal-e-Azam a film set in the
times of the great Moughul Empire. Having seen both the part B/W and
Colour and the remastered full colour version I can truly say that the
colourised version truly brings out the true glory of this amazing
classic putting it in a league way beyond the Classics of today. The
dialogue is simply superb and the acting truly amazing modern
filmmakers could learn thing or two about acting. The cinematography is
simply stunning for a movie of its time. the grandeur and opulence of
the sets really comes out in full colour. The story though not very
relevant for modern times shows the views and attitudes of India's
past. a truly great film to watch...

This film is by far one of the best, I have seen. One is sure to be
mesmerized by the love affair, the Mughal Emperor and the India of that
time. The film being in Urdu language also adds originality and aura.
The dialogs and direction is superb. The voice of late Prithvi Raj
Kapoor as Akbar is beyond compare. Salim, played by Dilip Kumar is one
of his best known acting and film. Madhubala seems great, and I
definitely feel, she rivals any modern day actress in her beauty, grace
and boldness and courage. I watched the latest 2004 re-release of this
film in a theater and the experience was superb. I had earlier watched
the movie (earlier release) in television before, but the latest
release in colour and Dolby digital sound adds to the experience.
Talking about a Hindi film, one definitely has to applaud it's songs.
Based on Classical music, the songs adds life to the film and are
strongly linked with the story-line as well. The best part I felt as a
modern gen. guy is the passion and the customs and respect towards
his/her duties and elders and system. Akbar's court was also known his
secular principles. He had cordial relations with Rajputs(Hindu) too
with his wife Jodha Bai herself being from Rajput clan and Man Singh as
the head of his infantry. The movie shows the love and emotions through
powerful poetic words (dialoges). This is one of the best parts of this
film. One can learn many things from this film and is sure to bring in
oneself an increased understanding towards one's duties and sacrifice.
A must watch for one and for all ... and do watch with keenness and
each word spoken in the movie is worth it.

Mughal-e-Azam is indeed a colossal of a movie and its spell binding
appeal and courtly grandeur has been further enhanced by the recently
released color version.Dilip Kumar, the icon of Indian Cinema and its first super star as
well, has rendered complete resonance to the hedonistic persona of
prince Saleem. The love travails of the myth of Anarkali have been
splendidly captured on the tinsel screen through the superb portrayal
by both, Madhu Bala and legendary Dilip Kumar. Besides, Pirthvi
RajKapoor has also projected the required prestige and magnitude to the
role of Emperor Akbar. It is worth watching, another time in color
scope.

Mughal-e-Azam is the culmination of a dream, of a man possessed to make
this movie - K Asif. (He made only one other completed movie) He spared
no costs to produce this period drama. For instance, the grandeur of a set for the "Sheesh Mahal" (i.e. the
palace of mirrors) appears for only a few seconds in the final print,
meant a lots of peculiar challenges for the cameras and lighting, it
cost a fortune, but K Asif still used it.R D Mathur's cinematography is brilliant. He used 8 cameras
simultaneously, for filming the battle scenes, which are surprisingly
realistic for a 1950s Bollywood movie. The close-ups of the romantic
scenes are also done very well. Dilip Kumar and Madhubala's performances and their on-screen chemistry
are great. Especially if you consider the fact that they had a break-up
in real life, and Dilip Kumar appeared as a witness against Madhubala
in a court case!Performances by Prithviraj Kapoor and Durga Khote might appear a bit
too dramatic and overdone. The dialogues of this movie are very poetic and crisp. (I am not sure
if translations and sub-titles could do proper justice to them)Western audiences would find this film a bit long, and then it has that
compulsory ingredient of any bollywood movie - the songs. (Which are
good if you understand the language and the poetry) This is not to say that film doesn't have its flaws - to show Akbar as
a compassionate king and to have a "happy ending" Asif changed the
popular legend by letting Anarkali escape through the false bottom of
the wall that opens out into a tunnel unknown to Salim. This defies the
internal logic of the tragic love story.But then even Ben Hur had that car in the chariot race!

A true masterpiece,featuring some of the greatest actors ever to grace
the Indian screen.Prithviraj Kapoor,the doyen of Indian Cinema is Akbar
himself and Dilip Kumar &amp; Madhubala both put in sterling performances
There is a question as to whether the storyline was actually true but
the very nature of the story indicates the level of religious tolerance
that existed at the time of Akbar.Akbar's wife Rani Jodhabhai was a
hindu and that was the mughal method of building bridges with their
hindu subjects.The role of Akbar would really serve as a model for
religious amity today.The major issue Akbar had in consenting to the
marriage of dancer Anarkali(represented by Madhubala) and Prince
Salim(Dilip Kumar) was the class status.After all it was the 16th
century All in all,a grand spectacle which showcases Indian culture at
its very best and grandest and leaves one to wonder at the relative
deterioration in subsequent centuries

Dear Reader, Its one of the best made movies ever, Excellent characterization
starting from Anarkali (Madhubala, the best actress India has ever
produced.), to Akbar, to Salim, even supporting actors characters are
too good like Durjan singh, and Manaraja Mansingh. The twists and turns
of the movie keeps you guessing and always on your toes. Its one of the
best and most celebrated movie of India cinema. The music and lyrics
you will keep rhyming for days after watching the movie. The new color
version of the old classic has given viewers one more chance to view
the hugely celebrated movie.Given a choice its worth seeing it N-times.Simply Excellent!!!TC, prakash
