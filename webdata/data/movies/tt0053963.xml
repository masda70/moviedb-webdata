Dated but extremely enjoyable light pop vehicle for Anthony Newley, who
since "Idle On Parade" had become a big name not only in acting but in the
pop charts too.
Newley stars with his good friend Bernie Winters, pretending to be a big
time crook to impress him. Bernie in turn tells "The Gang" who want "in"
with Newley, who has nick named himself as "the Cat".
Also stars Ted Heath and his music and the lovely Anne Aubrey, who's short
cinematic career showed more promise than she was allowed to provide!
Dance
sequences choreographed by Lionel Blair (with sister Joyce in the cast
too!)
Sheer delight! Enjoy and wallow in nostalgia!

I was very young when I saw this film, but remember laughing most of the
time, on the edge of my seat the rest.  I really cared what happened to
the
main character (Newley) - Spider certainly terrified me! James Booth a
very
under-rated actor. Lionel Jefferies was his usual exasperated self, Bernie
Winters the comic relief.  Why don't we see this film on tv???  A very
good
example of British early-sixties light comedy.

I remember this film with lots of love. Yet I never see it on TV. Is it
lost forever? I gotta find me someone to love sang Tone on the shore of
the Thames. Spider played by actor James Booth, (under rated?) Whom I
associate with as a London lad and the ever lovable Bernie Winters.There is a spiteful regress within British entertainment establishment
that Tony Newley has never been fully appreciated. He hit the heights
in Vagas, wrote some of the classic popular songs and had a long lived
and loved life, yet always the depressed clown. Only John Ross has done
anything for him in this last 20 years by a radio show on BBC2.Last time I saw him, Newley, was at the Hackney Theatre, or was it
Highbury, well, somewhere, and he was in great voice. 1990?If anyone knows how I can get Jazz Boat on tape or DVD please write.

1960? Really? The plot, such as it was is a childish take on an Ealing
Comedy and is basically a vehicle for Anthony Newley to hone his light
comedy acting chops. It's a real time capsule. The "kids" all look
about 25 and it's clear that the producers consider "jazz" something
those crazy kids will groove to. Ted Heath's Band (England's answer to
the American Big Bands of Glen Miller, Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey and
others)seems to be mostly decorative with Ted himself seen in several
shots. Costuming is another eyeopener, the non-acting extras are
basically in baggy jeans or corduroys, Aran sweaters (men)and twin sets
paired with flared skirts with voluminous slips beneath (ladies) - very
student style then - I suspect they were recruited from the many jazz
clubs around London at the time. In contrast Newley and the bad guys
chasing him wear sharp, tight fitting suits and Aubrey and Blair are in
cocktail dresses (why?). David Lodge is almost unrecognizable with a
full beard and glasses (at first I thought he was supposed to be a
rabbi...). James Booth is an early incarnation of his stereotype
Cockney villain and Bernie Winters is the comic foil as the traditional
"sidekick" that in US films always went to Phil Silvers, sadly Winters
lacks both the talent and charm of Silvers managing instead to irritate
and bore in equal measure. The film has value as a peep into the world
of popular music and youth fashion, the music and the clothes were what
their PARENTS had liked. In less than two years the whole music and
clothing world was thrown into turmoil with the arrival of The Beatles
and all the beat groups that followed them. Swinging London was about
to erupt and all the conventions that this film displays were swept
away.
