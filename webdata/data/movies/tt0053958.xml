This is a very well acted British film starring superstar Jayne
Mansfield and highly respected actor Anthony Quayle. The film begins as
Jayne plays a ruthless villianness type woman who gets her kicks
robbing banks and jewelry stores and such. She enlists the help of
lover Quayle only he gets caught but doesn't rat out Jayne or her gang
of thugs. While Quayle's character is in prison, Jayne continues the
heists and eventually opens a club. Quayle gets out and beautiful
Jaynie looks him up wanting the money he hid before he got caught.
Eventually as Quayle refuses to help Jayne and the gang her thugs
kidnap his son and chaos ensues. As you view the film you'll forget you
are watching a shoddy copy of the tape. My tape is from one of those
quickie $5.99 companies called EPI Entertainment Programs. Fans of
Jayne Mansfield positively MUST have this in their collection as her
performance totally dismisses the naysayers and she acts superbly. Yes
I am a fan but I can still honestly say her acting is A+ in this. Many
times people don't get past her beautiful face or incredible super
figure and forget about her acting which totally shines in this. I also
liked Barbara Mullen as Quayle's nervous wreck of a mother. Jayne and
Anthony also have a lot of chemistry together. And we are treated to a
lovely musical number by Jayne wearing a stunning and incredibly tight
evening gown. A must see! I only hope this will be remastered and
released to DVD ASAP!

...so did Mansfield star with another noted Shakespearean actor,
Anthony Quayle. The difference being that Mansfield was never the star
that Monroe was,and Quayle was just a jobbing actor in films, and the
production accorded them was a cheapie. Actually, for the first part of
this, with Mansfield hiding beneath a brunette wig, she is not bad, but
back to blonde for the last half of the film she resorts to her usual
simpering. The picture and sound quality of the CD is so bad, I could not even
take my usual pleasure in this sort of film of enjoying the cast of
familiar faces. The credits said Percy Herbert was in there somewhere,
but I didn't see him.

The only good thing about this film is the performance of Anthony
Quayle. He gives his character some depth and humanity. No wonder he
was soon off to great films such as Laurence of Arabia. If you want a
truly great performance by this actor watch Anne of the Thousand Days.
His role in that film earned him an Academy Award nomination. The good
thing about THIS film is that the plot was a great idea and the flow
was pretty quick and kept you interested. What was awful was the
quality of the picture and the sound. The actors were blurry and the
voices did not match the lip movements. Why was so much wasted on what
could have been a really decent movie? Perhaps age and a lack of good
DVD quality is the problem? The movie will only be bearable to Anthony
Quayle fans, Jayne Mansfield fans, or crime drama fans.
