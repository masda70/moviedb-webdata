One of the best British films of the sixties, The Entertainer was
written as an allegory of Britain's fall from grace by the leading
fist-shaker of England's band of Angry Young Men who stormed the London
stage with revolutionary new ideas and content, John Osborne. While
Look Back In Anger is a more decorated play, this film adaption by
Osborne and Nigel Kneale carried the flag of teeth-crunching kicks that
the gang of young playwrights hoped to startle the daylights out of
England with. Reading the other viewer comments, it is obvious most
folks were looking for a Disney story with a Shakespearean performance
by Lawrence Olivier. A happier ending? Great Britain forgot to supply
one, Andy up there in the mountains somewhere, and the seedy digs were
meant to be depressingly seedy, as was the dwindling talent of the
family, and its reliance in the end on the grand old name and the grand
old accomplishments of the past, as Archie Rice gave his best in
replacing his revered father, Billy. Note his offkey performance in
singing early on and then the eloquent on key final rendition of "Why
Should I Care" as the final performance ends not with a curtain call,
but with the hook, as the theater management (those other nations
running the world today) angrily demand that Archie get off the stage
because he is through, finished, washed up, fired, kaputsky, so long
and goodbye. From the direction of Tony Richardson to the selection of
grand old places along the sea that Britain once ruled with absolute
certainty, everything and every moment of this film are topnotch. The
aforementioned slandered scene with Roger Livesey as the Grandfather,
Billy Rice, and Brenda de Banzie as Phoebe Rice, involving a
misunderstanding over a piece of cake, is one of the most moving and
depressingly realistic family arguments ever written. It may not be
Olivier's greatest performance ever, but for certain it is the best one
ever filmed. It also features the film debut of two actors who would
establish themselves among the very best performers Great Britain has
offered us, Alan Bates and Albert Finney, along with the introduction
of Joan Plowright. As for the unkind comment about Olivier marrying
Joan Plowright and this somehow having an ironic similarity to the
theme of Archie and his young women; they married in 1961 and REMAINED
together until Olivier's death in 1989, which is completely the
opposite of the point made in the story. Well anyone is allowed to be
in error, but this great film has to rank with our own country's Night
of the Hunter as one of the most misunderstood films of all time. Don't
miss it,ever, and MGM Vintage Classics has issued an excellent DVD
edition.

I've seen this movie many times on tv and still feel irresistibly drawn into
the realistic setting of people's humdrum lives at a British seaside resort.
Some films can be viewed once and that's enough, but not this
one.All the cast members are remarkable in projecting the ordinary bleakness of
the story's circumstances -- the people, time and place, their foibles,
tragedies, and often futile efforts as they struggle with events. Believe it
or not, I even got to like Olivier's singing of "Why Should I
Care"!A memorable, thoughtful film well worth experiencing.

"The Entertainer" is a fascinating film based on the play by John Osborne
("Look Back in Anger"); Osborne co-wrote the screenplay.Olivier plays Archie Rice, a fading entertainer in a fading medium (music
halls) in a fading empire (the Suez crisis of 1956 figures into the
action).Archie's speech to his daughter (Joan Plowright), onstage in an empty
theater, about being dead behind his eyes, is especially
memorable.Along with other fine actors, Alan Bates and Albert Finney as his sons flesh
out this film, which is a must-see for fans of any of these
actors.

It is amazing to me how many critics and reviewers of this film seem to
have missed the subtleties in this story, and in Archie's character.
Far from living in a world of futile fantasies, I think, Archie's
character is much more accurately expressed by the line "The only thing
I know how to do is to keep on keeping on." All available options
(Canada, failure, escape, or perhaps, suicide) being unthinkable, what
choice has he but to chase another hopeless dream of somehow, finally,
nailing a successful show? Perhaps I identify with Archie more strongly
than many viewers, having myself been at the helm of a sinking ship (a
business.)One unreasonably scathing critic (did he actually watch this film??)
commented on Archie's daughter, Joan's, "blind love" for her father. I
think it was not "blind love" at all, but a recognition of the
(probably useless) courage Archie has to muster to continue to face
each day -- a day likely to hold for him only more demoralizing failure
and unceasing accusation and blame. And far from being totally selfish,
as some commentators have written, Archie really seems to be the only
person in the family able to look beyond the extremely small focus on
their own interests: he is, in fact, the only person in the Rice tribe
making a real effort, despite the pain, to find a path out of the mess
to a place of security for them all. Perhaps we have forgotten how dependent families were in that era on
the earnings of "the breadwinner," and yet, reviewers seem to have been
just as blind as many wives and families of that time to what a man
often had to give up in order to be that breadwinner, including, as in
Archie's case, any fantasies of greatness or even, finally, his last
shreds of self-esteem. Was Archie aware of his utter failure? Oh, I
think absolutely so. This is why his admission to his daughter that he
was "dead" behind his eyes. All the brightness of hope or illusions of
personal excellence have been hammered out of him on the iron-cold
anvil of real-world failure. Even so, he found it in him to dredge up
the understanding and compassion to alleviate his wife, Phoebe's
drunken crash into despair and hostility; and shore up his father's
nostalgic dreams. Though, alas, the latter, too, led to yet another
"unforgiveable" tragedy (-- or was it?.The most exquisite and poignant tragedy of it all is that maybe, just
maybe, Archie might have pulled it off, but for the failure of his
clueless family to understand him or the grim realities of his doomed
profession. Forget metaphors of Imperial England, this tale has surely
played itself out millions of times, whenever a new technology has made
an old craft obsolete -- as when the printing press replaced scribes,
or when electric lights eliminated the town's lamp lighter, or when
automated projectors replaced skilled projectionists. Many of the
movie's reviewers, in my opinion, are as blind to what is really going
on here as is Archie's family. They assume that Archie's failures are
the result of his negligence and selfishness, and that his dalliance
with the beauty queen is a real romance (and threat to their security),
when, in his eyes, it is just another, necessary, desperate and
ultimately demeaning business deal. Joan alone, it seems, finally
understands -- far too late to avert the inevitable end. Ultimately,
every family member's myopic conception of Archie's reality leads them
to take the reflexive steps that seal his doom.Shakespeare would have been completely a home with this tragic tale,
and I think it was not such a great leap away from Hamlet for Olivier.The story is richly-detailed, unexpected and though-provoking. And
Olivier is superb. A stunning performance from beginning to tragically
inevitable end.

Laurence Olivier is "The Entertainer," in a 1960 film based on the John
Osborne play in which Olivier played one of his greatest roles, Archie
Rice. He's surrounded by Joan Plowright as Archie's daughter Jean, and
Brenda de Banzie as his emotionally fragile second wife, Phoebe.
Olivier, Plowwright and de Banzie all repeat their stage roles, and it
was while in the play that Olivier and Plowright met, fell in love,
married, and stayed together until his death. Albert Finney is Mick and
Alan Bates is Frank, Archie's sons, and Roger Livesey is Billy Rice,
Archie's father and a beloved, well remembered music hall performer.
Daniel Massey plays the role of Graham. It's an auspicious cast of
veterans and newcomers.Archie has followed in his father's footsteps with a lot less success.
He's a second-rate entertainer - and that's being kind - in a seaside
resort - and his show is in trouble. Archie's in trouble, too, as he's
an undischarged bankruptcy and everything is in his wife's name. He's a
fairly overt womanizer, which makes his wife a wreck. She's afraid of
dying alone and wants the family to move to Canada and join a
successful relative in the hotel business. But Archie won't give up
following every dream in spite of some harsh realities. He takes up
with a 20-year-old second prize beauty contestant - her father's rich
and can back his new show.As I read through the reviews on IMDb, I have to wonder where some
people's hearts are. That's not a comment on the people, believe me,
rather on the world we live in. I can tell you this - if you think what
Olivier does isn't special and can't understand why he was nominated
for an Oscar, if you can't see that he is Everyman, if you can't see
the comment on Britain in general - you just haven't lived enough yet.
You'll see this film again one day and it'll hurt, believe me. There
can't be anyone my age, especially with ambition and a creative mind,
who can't understand what Archie Rice is going through. Though he's in
no way a sympathetic character, one can empathize with his life and
begrudgingly admire the fact that he refuses to take the easy way out.Jean, since she doesn't live full time with this bad road company
version of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" - i.e., her family - is
sympathetic to both Phoebe's hysteria and her father's delusions. The
scene over the cake - one of the reviewers on the board found it
disturbingly realistic - there's someone who knows dysfunction when he
sees it. A brilliant scene, but nothing beats Archie's monologue to his
daughter when he asks her to look at his eyes. "I'm dead," he says.Olivier has said this is his favorite character as it contains so much
of him. It's obvious from interviews with Olivier that it does. Like
many highly successful people, he began to see himself as Archie, a
kind of fake who, as Archie says, can be warm and smiling and feel
nothing. "It's all tricks," Olivier told writer Jack Kroll once. It's
not an uncommon feeling. It wasn't all tricks, of course, and as we see
in Archie's final version of the song that ran through the film, "Why
Should I Care?" he had finally reached the part of himself that makes a
truly great artist, like the woman he heard sing the spiritual.
Olivier, of course, hit those heights many times.England is pronounced as a "dying country" in the beginning of the
film, which sets up the metaphor of Archie as a symbol of the country.
I'm not British - it's for those who lived during that time period in
1960 to comment on it, and they have. There are some brilliant reviews
on the board covering that subject."Why Should I Care?" Archie sings. I don't have an answer. But if
anyone could make me care, it was always Lord Laurence Olivier, be he
the ruined man in "Carrie," the beautiful Heathcliff in "Wuthering
Heights," James Tyrone on stage in "Long Day's Journey," or Max de
Winter in "Rebecca." An amazing legacy, one in a million - don't miss
him as Archie Rice in "The Entertainer."

As someone who lives only a couple of miles away from where this film was
set, it makes me practically WEEP to see how busy and vibrant Morecambe
used
to be in the 50s/60s. OK, so the film is about how it's passed its heyday,
but compared to how it is now - seeing the same scenery (it's hardly
changed) - the Midland Hotel, The Winter Gardens (now a nightclub), it's
hard not to get painful pangs of nostalgia.This is ultimately a depressing film - Archie is one of those people who
deals with tragedy by "blanking" it out with bad jokes. In the film he
seduces the winner (2nd place) of a beauty contest - a woman old enough to
be his daughter. Shortly after the film, Laurence Oliver married Joan
Plowright who actually PLAYED his daughter in this film. Anyone for
irony?There are some wonderfully subtle takes on British "class" - I love Thora
Hird (a long way from Praise Be and Stannah Stairlifts here) as the
grasping
mum of the Beauty-contest winner, while Brenda de Banzie is great as
neurotic, looked-over, teary, nervy Phoebe - "I've got a new job in
Woolworths, on the electrical counter. It's OK, but the girls are a bit
common." Well Phoebe, you'll be pleased to know that the branch of
Woolworths is still there...

That little song that Laurence Olivier sings through out The
Entertainer as part of his musical hall act really does sum up his
philosophy of life. Outside of the classics this is Olivier's greatest role and some would
not even put that qualifier on his performance. Olivier retained great
affection for his role as Archie Rice. He said it contained more of the
real him than any other role.That's hard to believe because what Archie Rice is is a third rate song
and dance man. His father played by Roger Livesey was a great performer
back in the day. But Archie never has and never will make it to the
top. Think Frank Sinatra and Frank Sinatra, Jr. and you get some idea. He's more like Willy Loman in that he's facing his midlife crisis,
knowing full well he's not really accomplished all that much. Still he
plods on. Unlike Willy the luckless middle-aged salesman, Archie's full
of tricks. His credit is all gone, and he's planning to woo and win a
young beauty who's an airhead like her mom with the object of getting
their backing for a new show. He's ready to throw over wife Brenda
DaBanzie without a by your leave.The only one who Olivier has any kind of human feelings for is his
daughter played by Joan Plowright. It was in the original cast of The
Entertainer that Olivier first met the woman who became the third and
last Mrs. Olivier. When he was made a peer in fact Joan became Lady
Olivier.In fact from the Broadway production, Olivier, Plowright and DaBanzie
were the only ones from that cast who were in the film. But some rising
young talent like Alan Bates, Albert Finney, and Daniel Massey all got
some good first notice in The Entertainer playing Olivier's two sons
and Plowright's fiancé.The Entertainer is a downer of a film. There ain't a middle aged man
who doesn't know what Archie is going through. But our sympathies are
never with him. Usually that would mean one big box office flop if the
audience can't sympathize or empathize. But it's Olivier's skill as a
player that makes us want to see what does become of Archie.It's an ending, but in a very minor key. Well deserved I thought.

Archie Rice, the fifty-something vaudeville man at the center of the
action, has seen better days. He is relegated to play almost empty
houses in a seaside resort of England where he lives with his second
wife, Phoebe, his father Billy, and retired vaudevillian, and grown
children. Archie has an eye for good looking women, the younger, the
better. Archie Rice is a pathetic figure who lives in a world of his
own, always scheming about who to involve for one of his new shows,
that no one seems to care about.Jean Rice, the young daughter living in London, comes home for a visit
and she is horrified when she finds out what his father has turned out
to be. Jean sees what Archie is doing to Phoebe when he sees his father
kissing a much younger woman in a local restaurant. Archie has been
trying to convince her parents about the talents Tina doesn't have, in
order to take money from them to produce his new venture, which is only
an idea in his wild imagination.Tragedy strikes when young Mick Rice, who we had seen earlier as he
goes to fight in the Suez conflict, is first reported being taken
prisoner and eventually killed. While Phoebe goes to pieces, Archie
keeps doing what he only knows what to do. His final speech to an empty
theater, but directed to his daughter Jean, reveals the soul of this
troubled man.Tony Richardson made a great impression with his second directorial
job. He was attuned to the work of John Osborne, one of England's best
playwrights of the fifties and sixties that revolutionized the theater.
Mr. Richardson is helped by the crisp black and white cinematography by
Oswald Morris, who looks as sharp today as when the film was released.The main reason for watching "The Entertainment" is Laurence Olivier.
He completely dominates the action and makes us see how pathetic his
Archie Rice is. Mr. Olivier knew this man, having been connected to the
theater all his life. No one could have done a better job than him in
baring his soul for all of us to see. Laurence Olivier shows a tender
side in his scenes with Tina, the young woman who has captured his
fancy, and who is so young, she could be his own daughter.The rest of the cast is perfection. Roger Livesey, is seen as Archie's
father, Billy Rice, a man that has seen a lot during his lifetime and
now lives with a son that he knows is up to no good. Brenda DeBanzie is
fine as Phoebe, a woman of a certain age that is losing Archie. Joan
Plowright was Jean, the young daughter. Also in minor roles some actors
that will go to stardom in their own right, Alan Bates, Albert Finney,
and Daniel Massey, who died much too young. "The Entertainer" is a fine film that shows the talents of Laurence
Olivier and Tony Richardson.

The Entertainer is one of those great films that makes you stop and
think about the has been entertainers like Archie after their heyday. I
could see the relationship between Joan Plowright and Laurence Olivier
evolve from the screen into a love affair. Joan is quite brilliant
playing his daughter and Larry is well one of Britain's greatest
treasures from the theater. I also enjoyed Dame Thora Hird's role as
the mother of a contest winner. The story is rather complicated but it
is richly interpreteted onto the film. We feel sorry and love Archie
despite his obvious flaws and faults. We support him in the end and
know why he did it? After all the show must go on. Morecambe,
Lancashire is also Dame Thora's birthplace and hometown. It's great to
see legends like Dame Thora Hird, Dame Joan Plowright and Lord Laurence
Olivier.

The underlying theme of this movie is the end of the British empire,
played out in allegory with the end of a not very talented
"entertainer". The poet John Mansfield a few decades before this movie
was made gave Britons an inkling of what was coming. Two wars and a
softness grown out of a century of milking its colonies finally had to
come to end. This film is not what the average movie viewer wants, much
less understands when the creators of this project reveal to the
audience what lies ahead. When Archie is yanked off the stage, it is
the symbolic end of Great Britan as a great power. The Suez war and
Archies's son as a relic of Britan's once dominant power are a backdrop
to political and military events when this film was in production. The
Suez war was not backed by the US. The British learned that the day was
over when it could exert influence let alone dominant military actions
without US backing. Catch the line in the beginning of the film when
Archie's daughter is being asked to leave" a dying country". That line
establishes the events to follow, for Archie and England.
