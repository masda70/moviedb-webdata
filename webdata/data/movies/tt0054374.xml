Marcel Carné is a legendary film maker : we owe him some of the
greatest movies of all times... "quai des brumes", "hotel du nord", "le
jour se lêve", "les visiteurs du soir", "les enfants du paradis". It is
well known that his movies done after world war II don't have the magic
touch of the previous ones. If it is true, it shouldn't make us forget
the later movies of Marcel Carné. "Terrain vague" has been done in
1960. The times were the ones of the birth of a strange animal called
"the teenager" : post-war youth didn't want to stay "adults without
rights", they wanted fun, and most of all, they didn't want to be like
their parents. In France, Netherlands, Japan or the USA (and many
countries), it happened eight years later : the youth conquered some
power and didn't live like their parents did. In the movie, a gang of
Paris suburbs is bored on Sunday and tries to make money by robbing.
The life of great buildings is well described, there is a few very good
characters (the others are not bad but not very well developed), the
main actress (a former miss France) looks like France Gall (very famous
singer some years later). The soundtrack is not "rock'n'roll", it's a
quite classical symphonic music and this is interesting, the movie
therefore is not the typical lost teenagers story. The image is a
wonderful black and white (from Claude Renoir, nephew of Jean Renoir),
there is a lot of great scenes. Dialogues are not as good as what Carné
used to do with Jacques Prévert, but it is astonishingly modern
sometimes. So : not Carné's best, but not a shame at all, a lot could
be happy for their all life if they could make that kind of movie...

Based on American novel called "Tomboy" ,which makes sense cause the
leader of the pack is a girl who,like the precedent user pointed out
,resembled French pop singer France Gall.Daniele Gaubert would continue
her career through the sixties,her most celebrated part was " lonesome
the she wolf" a failed attempt at making a female "Diabolik".Then she
married ski champion Jean-Claude Killy and died from cancer at an early
age.It was the second time Carné had tackled the "youth" subject.In his
precedent -and IMHO much better- "les tricheurs" ,he told the story of
a girl ,Mic,who tried to be part of a circle of rich kids ,the golden
youth of Saint Germain des Prés."Terrain vague" is a different matter
,cause it takes place in poor milieus.Ouside Big Chief (Roland
Lesaffre, Carné's favorite actor and his spokesman in the movie),the
youngsters are beyond the adults' command ,and Carné is not afraid to
say it's high time they faced up to their responsibilities.The stairs
the tired lady is climbing step by step is a good metaphor of a lost
generation of parents when their baby boomers grow angry and tired of
the empty life they are about to live.No future .If nobody cares about
us,why should we care about them?That said ,the first part is a bit list less,but things go much better
in the second one,recalling sometimes "Rebel without a cause" ,a
feeling that the threesome Dan /Lucky /Babar reinforces : it will
remind you of Natalie Wood/James Dean/Sal Mineo in Ray's classic.This was arguably Carné's last good film (not great).All the films to
come would be disappointments.We must not forget,never forget ,that Marcel Carné was one of the
greatest directors of all time in his heyday (1936:"Jenny "to 1946:"les
Portes de la Nuit";between those two years, all Carné made was classic)
