Vitorrio Gassman is brilliant as a con artist in this movie. As best as
I can remember it (last time I saw it was in the early 70's in 16mm)
there are about 6-8 separate scenarios in which he pulls various cons,
all of which are hilarious. I've been searching for it in some form --
I'd even buy it in 16mm.Unlike "The Easy Life" ("Il Sorpasso"), in which he plays a similar
character and the movie is somewhat bittersweet, in "Love and Larceny"
the mood is always outrageous as the scams become more and more daring.
The plot itself is a flashback, gradually working its way up to the
surprise ending in the present.
