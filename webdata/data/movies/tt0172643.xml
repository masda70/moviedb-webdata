After Esalon Doktora M(1955), which was his first Yugo-Western, Serbian
director Zika Mitrovic made a name for himself by making his first
urban crime film Poslednji kolosek a year later. 4 years later, he made
Captain Lechi, his second and probably best Western film.After his home town Prizren in Kosovo is freed from German occupation,
a brave Partisan Captain Ramiz Lesi(Aleksandar Gavric in his first
major role)has to liquidate the remaining local Quislings(otherwise
known as Balists)who are hiding in the hills and are actively
sabotaging the new regime. They are led by an experienced,
German-trained soldier Kosta(Dimitar Kiostarov)and Ahmet(Rainer
Penkert), the brother of the famous Captain. The film centers on Ramiz
as he tries to get Ahmet out of the gang and hunt down the rest of the
Balists.Completely free of political influence, this film is great as pure fun.
It has all the elements of a good American Western: a tense, complex
plot, turbulent love affairs and a lot of shootouts. The acting is
great,especially by the main actors-Gavric, Petar Prlicko as his clumsy
companion and surrogate-father Sok,and Marika Tocinovska and Elma
Karlowa,2 completely different girls whose feelings for Ramiz will have
an effect on the main plot.Darko Damevski and Dusan Tadic(in his first
film role)are also funny as Balists Skender and Ibrahim.It is a pity that a great movie like this one has just one sequel,
right?
