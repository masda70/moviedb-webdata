Still recovering from serious head injuries sustained in a car crash,
motor racing driver Alan Colby and his wife Denise go on holiday to the
South of France. There, Alan is suddenly and unexpectedly struck with a
compulsion to strangle his wife. Hearing about this, Dr. David Prade, a
local psychiatrist, offers to help, but his offer is rejected by Alan
and he and Denise return to London. The psychiatrist follows them
there, convinced that sooner or later his services will be needed and
that he should be close at hand. At first, all seems well with Alan,
but then one morning he wakes from a long sleep to find that Denise has
disappeared. Worse, all the evidence points to his having murdered her.Beautifully filmed in black-and-white MegaScope by the great Gil Taylor
and masterfully directed by Guest, who was always at his best working
on suspense films, "The Full Treatment" is a minor classic.

"Stop Me Before I Kill" is a rather entertaining but often flawed film.
And, if you can look past its flaws, it will probably be worth your
time. The film starts with a race car driver getting in a terrible
accident. Months later, he comes out of a coma and appears to be
recovering quite nicely. However, he's obviously suffering
psychological after-effects--he's on edge, moody and sullen. What's
worse, he then tries to strangle his wife--on several occasions! With
the help of a psychiatrist and some dubious analytic psychiatry, the
man tries to work out why he's got this homicidal urge. But, there are
some BIG twists...Despite an excellent ending that makes this all worth while, here are a
few problems with the plot. First, although he has tried several times
to kill his wife, she stays with him and doesn't contact the police.
Duh! Then, you notice that the race car driver's wife goes from being
Italian to being French--her accent and language are a bit malleable!
Also, the real reason for all this homicidal behavior is too
obvious--there are too many clues to this and the film doesn't give the
viewer many other options to consider. Still, it works well enough
despite all this, though it's hardly a classic.

Brusque, high-strung, and short-tempered race car driver Alan Colby (a
solid and credible performance) is trying to recover from a serious
head injury. Alan and his loyal wife Denise (winningly played by the
sultry Diane Cilento) go on vacation to the South of France for some
much needed rest and relaxation. But Alan is having trouble resisting
his more violent impulses. Suave local psychiatrist David Prade (a
smooth portrayal by Claude Dauphin) offers to help Alan out. Director
Val Guest, who also co-wrote the overly talky script with Ronald Scott
Thorn, unfortunately allows the uneventful story to plod along at a
very slow pace and fails to generate much in the way of either tension
or excitement. The key problem with this film is that nothing much
happens; it's basically just a handful of people yakking up a storm for
an overlong hour and forty-eight minutes. The capable cast do their
best with the bland material, but their competent acting can't
completely alleviate the general tedium. Moreover, the pretty obvious
and predictable conclusion fails to deliver the goods as well. On the
plus side, both the lovely Cilento and the French scenery look
absolutely gorgeous while Gilbert Taylor's sharp black and white
widescreen cinematography and Stanley Black's swinging jazzy score are
up to speed. Passable, but overall a really blah and unmemorable
picture.
