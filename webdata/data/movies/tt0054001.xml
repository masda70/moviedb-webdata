This is an absolutely delightful movie, one of my all time favourites. It
is
a mixture of comedy, exitement, dark humor etc. The actors work terrificly
as in every Komisario Palmu movie. This movie has great turns and it
always
succees to scare me deliciously on the end. You can´t get tired of this
movie, I can assure you that!

Absolutely one of the best black &amp; white films made in Finland, but for
sure
the best Mika Waltari novel that has been filmed into a motion picture.
Even
beats The Egyptian(Sinuhe)(laugh). Murderer makes always one mistake and
you
make a mistake too if you don´t watch this one. Film includes old Helsinki
scenes and fabulous actors, very scary + jazzy music score.And hey, did you know that loads of hilarious amateur film versions have
been made of "Komisario Palmu", inspired by this classic Finnish crime
film.
Perfect.
