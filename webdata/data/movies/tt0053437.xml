The somewhat familiar story of a well-to-do "good" boy who gets
involved with a "bad" girl from the poor side of town. The story of
Anders, a promising student and the apple of his parent's eye, and
Gerd, a "wayward" girl who is the bane of her single mother's
existence, "You little whore!" . . . "Whore's do it for money. I do it
for pleasure!" Sound a bit like a bad "B" movie? It's not. At it's
heart "Ung Flukt" is about the unnatural corrupting influence that
"civilization" has on human beings, especially the young, rudderless,
and in Gerd's case, fatherless. Anders, having had the benefit of a
stable family life, has direction and purpose and it is his idealism
that provides the source of conflict between him and his parents. He
believes that if he could remove Gerd from her hazardous environment,
he could save her. Is he motivated by love? Moral duty? A sense of
righteousness? Gerd is in love with Anders but is frightened that he'll
turn out like her other lovers, "You'll just use me while it's fun." In
a bold move, Anders takes Gerd by surprise on a long trip into the
forest, first by car and then by foot, to a cabin that he had visited
with his Father. At first this environment seems harsh and unforgiving,
"Is there no end to this forest of yours?" Gerd complains while finally
getting rid of her cumbersome city shoes. "Soon you'll get used to it
and will no longer need clothes." Soon the two lovers are running
through the forest barefoot, swimming naked in the lake, happy and
carefree under the warm sun. But clouds will eventually turn the sky
gray and Gerd, like an addict, will be torn between the Good healthy
life and a craving for the pleasures and conveniences of the city. Soon
their parents will come looking for them. Soon a mysterious and
dangerous stranger will enter their orbit and Anders will undergo a
"rite of passage" for his manhood with Gerd hanging in the balance. A
beautifully photographed and extremely well paced story that showcases
the talents of a phenomenal actress, even at such an early stage in her
career. Liv Ullmann delivers a positively scintillating and sexy
performance as Gerd, one that would be emulated a year later, wittingly
or unwittingly, by Lee Remick in Elia Kazan's "Wild River" in which
Nature would also play a crucial role.
