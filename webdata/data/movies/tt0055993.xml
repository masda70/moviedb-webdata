Yes, this is The Nudist Story! I saw the film in Chicago when I was
young. I loved the British actress who played Miss Jane Robinson. This
is my favorite nudist movie of all time. Something Weird Video sells it
and I purchased a tape. I am wondering if there is a DVD version now. I
would have liked to have seen the outtakes because all of the pubic
regions have been edited out of this film, although I saw a magazine
years ago that showed the actors and actresses completely nude. A cute
little story. The Avonmore Sun Club must be sold to pay the taxes on
the estate. The handsome lawyer tries to convince Jane to keep the club
open for the members who have been enjoying the club for a very long
time. Jane eventually visits the club. Very nice.

This title has been available for quite some time from Something Weird
Video under the title For Members only, The Nudist Story. This was the
original complete title in the UK. Film quality is excellent. The
opening credits briefly switch from the original to the title page of
"Pussycat Paradise" and then back to the original. That was a brief
alternate title in the mid to later 60s.I don't have any idea how long this movie has been available, but it
was a happy shock to learn of it's original British title, Google it,
and discovery that it has been here for some time. Beyond the opening credits, the film remains complete and beautiful
quality. There is even a film trailer after the end of the feature.

I saw a movie with the same title,in color.I loved the story and the movie.I
have been looking for a copy of it for years with no luck.It was about a
girl who somehow had the authority to confiscate a nudist camp because
somehow she was in control of its assets.The participants wanted to show her
around,and convince her of the wholeness of the nudist lifstyle.She
reluctantly agreed to meet the nudists.She became somewhat attracted by a
man who ran the camp.She was showed the camp by him.Later,she removed her
clothes and participated in the lifestyle.The camp was saved.Another actress
liked the same guy,so there was a little catfighting going on.This lady was
introduced to another nudist couple,who were friends with the man who ran
the camp.So they helped convince her of the wholeness of the
lifestyle,also.I remember her eating an apple,sitting at a picnic table with
this man.It was a cute scene.Also,there was some kind of a party for "the
old lady",who was the actual owner.Can you help me locate this
film?
