This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made in denmark, and it is
better than the new "Dogme-movie" which was popular in the late
90'ies.
The movie is about a young girl (Ghitha Nørby) at a gas station who
suddenly
discover that she is the lawfull successor of a baroness (Maria
Garland).
The young girl (Anne) moves to the land steward and has to be trained to
be
a fine woman. For exapmle must Anne learn french which she pronounces
quite
funny.
The dilemma is between Anne and the baroness, and gradually they learn to
appreciate the way they are, but now without some conflicts...
Naturally Anne falls in love (or does she?).
Put together is the movie a great movie full of funny episodes and Maria
Garland and Dirch Passer makes the movie worth seeing again and again and
again...You never get to se the movie too many times.
I hope that you agree,

Gitta Nørby and Dirch Passer are just simply great in this movie about a
sweet young girl who works as a mechanic when she suddenly finds out she is
the heiress to a beautiful estate/castle. The complication which follows
when she has to move into the castle and suddenly become a "fin dame"
educated woman is extremly funny. Ove sprogø and karl stegger are just
great
to. The castle's ghost is also very funny and the battle between the
Rosenstens and the Ravenfelds are superb. The elderly baroness and the
young
Gitta Nørby's controversy gives the movie an extra dimension.The funny scene at dinner:
Skal jeg sige det på den måde...Ja gør som jeg siger...meget vel......HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
