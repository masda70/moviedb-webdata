In 1957 Gustaf Gründgens staged a new production of Goethe's Faust in which
he once again played Mephisto, a part he had played since 1932. The
brilliant production was a huge success and ran for a couple of years. In
1959 Peter Gorski captured the performance on film in his directorial film
debut. Basically it is a registration of the production, but Gorksi did
manage to accentuate the details of the acting by using enough medium and
close-up shots which give a view on the acting you normally would not able
to see in a theater. How fortunate it is and how happy we can be that at least this Mephisto of
Gründgens is on film (I do not know of any other Faust production with
Gründgens on film). Here we can see his brilliant, if not obsessive acting
to the full. Here we can also see that, although Gründgens was know for not
being in favour of "modernization" of classic plays, he was not entirely
against it either. The stage set is simple and almost bare which gives the
production a certain light touch. Faust himself is a young man (without long
beard!) who is a nuclear physicist (an idea given to Gründgens by Will
Quadflieg); a very clear reference to the then nuclear race. According to
Heinz Reincke (interview on tv) the exploding of the atom bomb was more
sensational on stage than in this film.So, not only for Gründgens this is a fascinating film, the staging and
interpretation of the play as well make it wonderful viewing; for the first
time he included the prolog. While watching this production I hardly need to
consult Goethe's text; the cast read their lines with a wonderful sense of
rhythm and very, very clear; productions nowadays can learn something from
this. Not only Gründgens' acting can be admired, under the supervision of
Gründgens the complete cast is extraordinary.Highly recommended and a must-see for all those studying or interested in
German language and culture.(8/10)

I have seen many Versions of Goethes Faust, but the one with Gustaf
Gruendgens and Willi Quadflieg is the best I have ever seen. The Plot
should
be clear. Gustaf Gruendgens plays Mephisto. It is the Role that made him
live forever. He dominates the play, often on cost of the other actor,
but
it is magnificent. It is a must to see.
