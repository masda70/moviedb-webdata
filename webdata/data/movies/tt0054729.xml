The cast is really international:Anne Heywood (English),José Suarez
(Spanish) ,Daniel Gélin and Pierre Brasseur (French) and for all
that,Italians(Paolo Stoppa and Terence Hill here credited as Mario
Girotti).The film is supposed to tell Carthage 's last stand .The Romans wanted
the city to be destroyed then rebuilt some miles away from the shore.A merchant,the villain, (Gélin,at his worst) wants to negotiate but a
soldier(Suarez ),the hero,wants to fight against the enemy.After this
start ,nothing makes sense: the plot gets bogged down in uninteresting
love rivalries ,most of the time away from Carthage city .When it
finally comes back to the essential (that is to say the Romans'
impending victory) it's only to show (and the title is no lie) Carthage
in flames .An ending a la "last days of Pompei" without a volcano,where
the villains are punished and the heroes rewarded.

Huge scale historical romance set against the backdrop of the Rome/
Carthage wars in the 2nd century BC. The production is amazing with a
scale and a look that few films, even the Hollywood epics ever matched.
As jaw dropping spectacle the film is top of the heap. However the film
suffers from a storyline that is at best soap opera as a wounded
soldier is saved by a priestess who falls in love with him while he has
love elsewhere. Things get complicated as the soldier leaves to rescue
his lady love with the priestess in tow, causing a great deal of
friction for everyone. At the same time the Romans attack Carthage…and
then it gets even more complicated. It seemed to have been plotted by a
monkey on espresso who just wanted to keep things movie, since there is
way too much going on since after awhile I began to get lost.(being
tired didn't help either).Its not bad its just ..please stop enough
already. Worth a look for those who like spectacle or for those who
like historical romance.
