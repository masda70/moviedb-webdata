Not the way the French pupils and students remember him.He was not a
jolly fellow .When he died,soon after le Cardinal de Richelieu ,both
were not mourned.But "le Capitan" takes place during the king's youth
,when Concini was ruling the country on behalf of the queen mother Anne
d'Autriche,and when Richelieu was a Concini protégé -he does not appear
anyway- Jean Marais was cast as Jean Marais the fair knight, a part he
played in half a dozen of swashbucklers of the era("le capitaine
Fracasse","le miracle des loups" "le bossu" "le masque de fer" "les
mysteries de Paris" ..).Elsa Martinelli, a former Kirk Douglas protégée
supplies the love interest :a belle who wants her father to become king
and thus to overthrow the legitimate one.Concini was ,even in history,a
true villain who squandered the money that Sully ,Henri the Fourth's
minister, had amassed.In the movie ,he becomes a super villain ,trying
to kill his king by poisoning him or drugging his horse .Why not?
Bourvil and Pierrette Bruno provides the flick with a welcome comic
relief.Those old Marais movies retain a certain charm.History was given a
rough ride,à la Alexandre Dumas,but they are still enjoyable
today.Recommended for the family.

Good swashbuckler set in France by the time King Louis XIII was just a
teenager. It seems that nobody wants to see him sitting on the throne,
including his lovely mother. But there is a loyal nobleman who will fight
bravely to put things in order. Legendary French actor Jean Marais is a
bit
too old to play the hero but he tries hard and really does a good job. As
the comic relief, comedian Bourvil plays the street artist who helps
Marais
in his mission. Fencing and action sequences don't look as great as in
Errol
Flynn's classics but the old castles are real and "Le Capitan" provides a
good fun for its audience. By the way, English title "Captain Blood" makes
no sense; this captain has no relation neither to 1935 Hollywood classic
nor
to Rafael Sabatini's novel (this one is based on Michel Zevaco's
histories).
