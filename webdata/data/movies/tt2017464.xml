From the new Eclipse set, The Warped World of Koreyoshi Kurahara.
Criterion had previously released a Kurahara film, I Am Waiting, in
their Nikkatsu Noir Eclipse set (one of the absolute must-haves from
the Eclipse series). This new set is almost a follow-up to that one,
with five Nikkatsu films by Kurahara. Intimidation is a tight little
crime flick, running only 65 minutes. Nobuo Kaneko is a bank manager
who has embezzled a bunch of money from his bank. Kojiro Kusanagi plays
a blackmailer who has discovered this. He attempts to make Kaneko rob
his own bank. In the process, Kaneko humiliates the night manager, Ko
Nishimura (who gives a wonderful performance), a high school friend of
his who frequently finds himself under Kaneko's boot. The most notable
thing about the film are its two exquisite bank robbery set-pieces. The
first is a dream, filmed entirely in a POV shot, Lady in the
Lake-style. The actual robbery is almost entirely silent, as Kaneko,
his face hidden behind a bandanna, cannot make a sound lest he be
identified, forces Nishimura at gunpoint to help him complete his
mission. It's a gripping, beautifully realized sequence. The theme of
class is prevalent throughout the film with the relationship between
Kaneko and Nishimura. The story itself is kind of flawed and not
especially believable, unfortunately. It also grinds to a halt after
the awesome robbery sequence, drowning itself in a ton of expository
dialogue. The kernels of this film definitely could have grown into
something fantastic. As it is, it's a good little noir.
