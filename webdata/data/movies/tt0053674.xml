I have the video of this movie and can watch it over and over again. I
speak
and understand German.
The outstanding moments are:
1. When Schwejk loses his way after being thrown off the train for pulling
the "communication cord" - he goes around in circles then finds his way
back
to where he accidentally left his tobacco pouch. His comment "Alles hat
sein
tiefen Sinn" is "goldich"
2. When a sniper shoots his pipe from his mouth, and Schwejk shouts to the
effect "You might have killed someone!"
3. When he arranges with his friend to meet at "half-past six after the
war".
The whole film has me curled up laughing, although the anti-war moral is
quite serious.

This old austrian-czech stories provided the story for the  'honest'
soldier
Schwejk, who arranges life to his own, not honest, but 'honest'. This movie
gives an insight of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy with its many ethnies
and attitudes before WW 1. Rühmann starres charming and smiling, like in
other movies.
