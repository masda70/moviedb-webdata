The movie is based on a true story. Rommel has planted two German spies in
Cairo. They are his "ears and eyes" in the British eight army. Rommel is
looking for information which can help him plan an attack on Cairo. The
plot
is good and interesting and the film holds the story together. It is quite
clear that the budget is low, most of the scenes are shot in studios. The
story is told in a slow pace, sometimes to slow- it never gets exciting!
The
acting is quite good all over, despite a few minor roles. Actor Michael
Caine acts in a minor role as a German; Hans. Foxhole in Cairo is a nice
little film, nothing more, and add up to 4/10
