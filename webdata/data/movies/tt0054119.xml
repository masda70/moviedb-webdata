This was the first 'mainland European' film I saw as a teenager in the
early 60s. I saw it on late-night television and it knocked me out.
Later on I saw Wajda's 'Generation' trilogy and could barely believe
that this was the same director. I have subsequently seen it on the big
screen a couple of times and it remains a favourite from its era. The
reason was simply that the creative force behind 'Innocent Sorcerers'
is not Wajda but Jerzy Skolimowski.You only need to take a look at 'Walkover' to see the same callous and
alienated attitude of the central character. However, for me, 'Innocent
Sorcerers' is a superior film to Skolimowski's earliest directorial
works as, through the character of Pelagia, a much greater warmth and
meaning is expressed.Krystyna Stypulkowska makes a perfect Pelagia - coquettish and
flirtatious, but still innocent. The exquisite scene of 'tossing the
matchbox' is more erotic than all but a handful of 'explicit' sex
scenes from modern cinema.There are few films from Eastern Europe in the Soviet era that ever
make you really care about the characters - this is definitely one.
