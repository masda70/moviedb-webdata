The first serial about the children of Bullerby belongs to my very first
television experiences. I don't remember how old I was; but it was
certainly
before I came to school, that means before my six years of age. I was
pretty
fascinated by the children going barefoot through nature, I adored their
boundness to nature. I feel this fascination until today, after more than
thirty years. I still like all the films of Astrid Lindgren and feel the
same as I felt at that time.
