An earnest and largely successful attempt to portray life in ancient
Egypt through the story of an ambitious woman who aggressively hooks up
with three young nobles by swimming out to their pleasure barge on the
Nile river, rather like an eager groupie going along for a joy ride.
Eventually, the rival lords (Barrymore and Francioli) each become a
pharaoh, one of upper and one of lower Egypt. The girl (Linda Cristal)
becomes a queen but her ambition ends in ruin as the two kings war with
each other. The third lord (Brice), a loyal physician is finally
rewarded by pairing up with the deposed queen. Costumes, sets, and such
props as the royal barge are convincing with colorful period detail and
Cristal is lovely, as usual.
