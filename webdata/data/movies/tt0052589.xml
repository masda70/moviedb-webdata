The title of this Italian heist comedy means "Daring Strike by the Usual
Unknown Persons" and the movie is a sequel to the great comedy by Mario
Monicelli "I soliti ignoti" or "Big Deal on Madonna Street," where a group
of two-lira Roman thieves attempt to break into a bank vault. While this one
has its moments of humor and engagement, it is not on the same par with its
predecessor and is replete with longueurs, despite many of the first-rate
performers from the previous entry including Vittorio Gassman, Renato
Salvatori, Claudia Cardinale, and that absolute treasure of a screen
presence, Carlo Pisacane. The plot involves the same group of bunglers as in
the previous film. Here they plot to steal the soccer pool after the big
Milan championship match.  (The film was known in the U.S. as "Fiasco in
Milan.") Everything imaginable, of course, goes awry, before, during, and
after the heist.  The true heist here is that the film is stolen by the
inimitable Carlo Pisacane as Capanelle, a shriveled, lovable old codger with
a squeaky voice and totally useless member of the group.  His passion is
less for the spoils than for the food he gets along the way, and
uncontrollably feeding his ravenous wrinkled old face at any and every
moment he can. Bravo Carlo, this movie is yours!  This picture was directed
by Nanni Loy, who made the wonderful "Detenuto in attesa di giudizio," 
"Four Days of Naples" and "Scugnizzi."
