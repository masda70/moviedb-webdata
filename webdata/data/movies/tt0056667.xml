First, I am happy to see that this film has been re-released to video and
perhaps a DVD is to follow.  As a follow up to THE RED BALLOON I like the
French title VOYAGE EN BALLON better than STOWAWAY IN THE SKY.  This is a
gentle film that floats you across the French countrysides and town church
steeples.  One of the six classic Albert Lamorisse films for children this
was his first full length feature and sequel to THE RED BALLON.  Once
again
starring Lamorisse's son Pascal in the lead role, this time stowing away
in
a 60-foot tall orange balloon his grandfather made.  The two journey
across
France in an adventure that is brilliantly and colorfully photographed.
The
only disappointment is that the balloon should have been red (a
reincarnation of the balloon from the first film), but perhaps orange was
a
better choice against the French backdrop.  If you loved THE RED BALLOON,
this is a must for you.

After the huge success of THE RED BALLOON in this country Jack Lemmon bought
the US distribution rights of Albert Lamorisse's next film VOYAGE EN BALLON.
But instead of releasing a dubbed version here he hired Broadway veteran S.
N. Berhman to write a script  &amp; re-recorded the film's soundtrack with
himself reading this script.  Berhman's script takes away all the mystery
from Lamorisse's little movie &amp; negates its visual composition.  Lemmon's
cacophony throughly trashes Jean Prodromides' beautiful score.  As a topper
Berhman's script has references to adult sexuality (this in a children's
movie) which are meant to be sophisticated &amp; amusing but are not.  Won't
some one please give us the original?
