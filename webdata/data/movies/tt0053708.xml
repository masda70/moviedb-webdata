"Chhalia" is Manmohan Desai's first film, with telltale signs of the
emerging showman's narration skills. The story is set around the
Partition era when Kewal (Rehman) leaves behind his newly wedded wife
Shanti (Nutan) in Lahore, for reasons not divulged to the viewer.
Shanti makes it to India a few years later with her little son, in the
hope of being reunited with her husband.Kewal is overjoyed to meet his wife and son, but everything goes wrong
when the boy introduces himself as "Anwar". As for his father's name,
he replies "Abdul Rehman". Kewal abandons his wife and son. After
leaving the boy in an orphanage, Shanti tries to kill herself but is
rescued by Chhalia (Raj Kapoor), who shelters her. Chhalia falls in
love with Shanti only to learn of her previous marriage and her son.The story now meanders tortuously towards the inevitable reunion of
Kewal and his family. A subplot involves a meaningless showdown between
Abdul Rehman (Pran), and Chhalia. The climax is set at the scene of
Dussehra festivities, where the effigy of Ravana is to be burnt.
Chhalia draws parallels between Shanti and Sita in a seemingly unending
Rafi song to convince Kewal of her fidelity.Nutan and Raj Kapoor are largely wasted in this movie. The plot lacks
substance and lacks credibility at times, while the narration meanders
meaninglessly. The climax is almost insufferable. Music by Kalyanji
Anandji is a definite plus though. "Chhalia mera naam", the timeless
"Dum dum diga diga" and "Mere toote hue dil se" are among Mukesh's most
popular renditions.
