One of the best film of Italian movie history since its foundation and
therefore one of the best movies ever made. Astonishig debut by movie
director Florestano Vancini, who was unfortunately never able to go
even near this gifted artwork for the rest of his career. Working on a
powerful story by Italian novelist Giorgio Bassani (The Garden of The
Finzi-Continis, The Golden Glasses). For the impressive effort of the
cast, all of them taking their respective role characters to epic
proportion (while being extremely real and human), and for the black
and white photography of night and day war-time Ferrara which reminds
sometimes the Vienna of the Third Man by Carol Reed, it is much
superior to Rossellini's Open City and General Della Rovere. It is
certainly not strange but still remarkable that the terrible WWII
Italian experience has inspired such cogent insight of the human
condition. For its immediate impact the movie can be compared to "Two
Women", for its complexity it is certainly superior. To be listed among
the hall of world's masterpieces.
