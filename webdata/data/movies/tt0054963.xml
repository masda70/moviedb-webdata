One of the numerous film versions of the compelling story of The Hands of
Orlac, a pianist who has a murderer's hands grafted on to his after an
accident.  This time Mel Ferrer is Stephen Orlac.  Ferrer actually does a
pretty good job in this rather complex role of someone being torn apart not
by the fact that he kills but rather by the thought that he sometimes
thinks
he must or will kill.  There is only one murder in this film, so if action
is your poison you might want to pass.  However, despite the lack of action
and any real budget in this film, the film is rather good, especially
during
the second half where the pace is picked up considerably.  Christopher Lee
as a blackmailing magician is the real star of the film as he plays one of
his oiliest, slickest bad guys on film.  Lee oozes a kind of vitriolic
charm
as he maniacally laughs and speaks ever so nicely whilst blackmailing.
Danny Carrel plays his lovely French-speaking assistant with gusto, charm,
and lusciousness.  The film has a good cast of character actors like Felix
Alymer, Donald Pleasance in a meaningless yet nice cameo, and Sir Donald
Wolfit in an equally small role.  Modern(what passed for modern then) music
plays throughout.The film is markedly different from many other versions,
and in particular Mad Love.  It has an interesting twist ending.  All in
all
a pretty good little film.

Christopher Lee told online entertainment site 'Entertainment Asylum' that
there were some movies of his that he'd never watch again. This one was
undoubtedly one of them. The dialogue and plot are banal, and the
background
music is virtually nonexistent, meaning that the movie is full of long,
pregnant pauses as actors stride into rooms to read their
lines.Nevertheless, Christopher Lee plays an excellent villain. In fact, when
put
up against Mel Ferrer's weak portrayal of concert pianist Stephen Orlac,
it's impossible to avoid rooting for the bad guy.This is a picture of British horror entertainment before Hammer came
along.
All I can say is, thank goodness for Hammer! Watch it for Lee's acting,
Other than that, be prepared to laugh your head off.

A good story and a good cast are wasted in this amateurishly written
and directed misfire. It's nearly as bad as Ed Wood films like PLAN
NINE FROM OUTER SPACE.How these no-talents managed to engage so many name actors is a
mystery. It was a French production, I guess, and they tried to film it
in French and English, but the results are amazingly tacky and clumsy.Virtually every scene falls flat or is unintentionally funny. But it's
not quite bad enough to be good, like PLAN NINE. It's just bad.What's worse? Christopher Lee's unintentionally comic "maniacal
laughter"? Or the jaunty, jazzy musical score. Apparently no one told
the composer he was writing music for a horror film. The grimmest
scenes are accompanied by toodling flutes and cheery jazz riffs that
would be more appropriate to a 1960s documentary on "Swingin' London".The best version BY FAR of this much-filmed story is 1935's MAD LOVE,
directed by the great Karl Freund, with Peter Lorre.
