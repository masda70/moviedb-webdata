A great film which I love to see over and over again. It trumps with
great actors, a nice scenery and beautiful songs.Some may think them to be out of date but if you give this film a
chance - by not expecting a film where violence and sex scenes
alternate, but good, solid acting and great songs - you won't be
disappointed. Of course, it is slight fare but it doesn't pretend
otherwise and provides good entertainment. It is always nice to see films with Peter Alexander, Waltraut Haas and
Gunter Philipp (etc); the quality in acting is great. One can't help
but like these actors and believe what the stories they're 'telling'.Personally, I can't resist the voice of Peter Alexander and love his
songs.

I saw this when I was a child and even today I can remember the title
track and "Was Kann Des Sigismund Dafür, Daß Er so Schön Ist ?" which
was translated into French as "On A Le Béguin Pour Célestin" .I can
remember Josepha the inn's owner and her butler ,Leopold ,in love with
her.Then the guests' arrival and love is around the corner;the plot is
made of lovers' to-ings and fro-ings.Everything can happen in that inn
,even the emperor Frances -Josef can come ;this chocolate box Austria
with its Agfacolor (like in the Sissi saga ,another dear memory) is as
kitsch and as charming as the old Christmas cards.I wish I could see it
again!
