I saw this on French TV about a year ago - a great ensemble performance by
3
of the best (though aged) French actors hamming it up - kind of the
outcasts
of their little town due to general crochetiness (especially a destructive
rampage by Gabin at a dance hall). The most memorable scene finds them
lost
in open country, where an unreadable signpost is discovered.  Much arguing
ensues.  Much wine is also consumed on the way to their final rest...home.

More like an inside joke for French audience, this movie would have limited
appeal to a North American audience.

A lot of Jean Gabin films are coming out on DVD these days. The actor
certainly made some of the greatest french films of all time (La grande
illusion, La bête humaine, Touchez pas au grisbi, Quai des brumes,
etc.) but this film is one of his very worst. The most annoying thing
here is how often the three main characters shout at each other. Not
only are their dialogs not really that funny but all three actors have
to say their lines with a thick countryman accent that makes them even
uglier to listen to. Jean Gabin was a very faithful actor when it came
to working with certain directors but obviously Gilles Grangier was no
Jean Renoir and, as for most of Gabin and Grangier collaborations, you
can surely skip this turkey!
