...there was the Nouvelle Vague.
Tire au flanc 62 it's a wild comedy about the army. Truffaut and his
friend
Claude De Givray (Stolen Kisses and Bed and Board co-writer) made this
film
to laugh at institution that ruined part of their lives.
Fast paced and deliberate chaotic, Tire au flanc 62 tells the story of two
young men trying to make fun of their duty at the army.Very close to the Cahiers du Cinema point of view about the modern cinema,
this movie it was a step forward of the genre and one of the first
contemporary comedies.

No charm, no finesse, strictly no fun at all! One of those films by
Truffaut (I know full well that he is far from the only person
responsible) that makes me stop and think: did he really have a sense
of humor? Avoid at all costs! Go straight for his films of passion: The
Silken Skin with the wonderful, wonderful Francoise Dorléac, or The
Siren of Missisippi, with her sister, Deneuve. Or, of course The 400
Blows. Certainly, there are more great films by him, such as the really
great thriller The Bride Wore Black, for example - Truffaut at his very
best and most entertaining, and also his last two films of great
passion and dark deeds: The Woman Next Door, and Confidentially Yours.
But please, for your own good, avoid this!
